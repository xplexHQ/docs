:::tip[Balanced Approach]
Running <Xplex /> with Docker is a good balance between ease & flexibility. Unlike [1-click setup](/setup/1-click), you're not tied to a cloud provider; and unlike [native setup](/setup/native), there's not much to go sideways.

## Create instance

It's recommended to <Badge text="create instances with Docker preinstalled" /> for ease of operation. You can use the smallest instance size, but choose the <Badge text="closest data center location" /> to you.

:::note[Alternatively]
You can also start with a generic linux server, and manually [install Docker](/refs/check/docker) on it.

## Run Checks

If you're using an existing homelab or cloud server with other services running on it, or even on a new system with preinstalled software packages&mdash;validate that it meets the requirements to run <Xplex />:

<Steps>

1. [**Verify superuser access**](/refs/check/superuser)
2. [**Ensure Docker is installed**](/refs/check/docker)
3. [**Look out for conflicting nginx**](/refs/check/nginx)
4. [**Confirm required ports are free**](/refs/check/ports)
5. [**Set firewall rules to open the ports**](/refs/change/firewall)

</Steps>

## Run Container

```bash title="Run the xplex container"
docker run -d --name xplex -p 80:80 -p 1935:1935 xplex/xplex
```

Open a browser & access your <Xplex isHQ /> dashboard at `http://<hostname-or-IP>/`

That's it... you now have a running <Xplex /> instance, which is ready for the [post-installation setup](/setup/postinstall).
