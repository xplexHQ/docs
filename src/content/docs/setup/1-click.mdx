:::note[**"1-click"** is a marketing term from DigitalOcean]
In reality, you need more than 1 click. It stands to mean that you can deploy <Xplex /> without needing to use CLI. This page will give you a step-by-step visual guidance on how to do that.
:::

## Create DigitalOcean Account

In order to deploy <Xplex /> as a 1-click Droplet, you need to log in to your DigitalOcean account. If you don't already have a DigitalOcean account, please create one by signing up with the following link:

## Initiate <Xplex /> Deployment

From Marketplace| From Dashboard
:--------------:|:--------------:
Either, visit <Xplex /> on [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/xplex) & click on the `Create xplex Droplet` button | Or, from the [DigitalOcean dashboard](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/) click the `Create > Droplets` buttons on the top-right

## Set Droplet Preferences

Once in the droplet creation wizard, you need to go through a few steps to set up the droplet. Detailed steps have screenshots to guide you through the process.

<Steps>

1. <details>
   <summary>Choose Region &mdash; for the nearest datacenter</summary>
   **Closest datacenter region will ensure lowest latency**. Leave the datacenter ID (e.g. SFO1, SFO2, SFO3 in SFO region), and the VPC Network to whatever is chosen by default; you shouldn't have to change those, in general.

   </details>

2. <details>
   <summary>Choose an image &mdash; the preconfigured snapshot</summary>
   If you've started from 1-click link on <Xplex />'s marketplace listing page, then the correct latest image will already be selected for you&mdash;you don't have to do anything.

   If you've manually started the process of creating a droplet, then search for `xplex` in the marketplace images & then click to select it.

   </details>

3. <details>
   <summary>Choose Size &mdash; the smallest droplet is sufficient</summary>
   <Xplex /> is a very lightweight solution. So, choose the `SHARED CPU` droplet type, and `Regular` as the CPU option. Click the arrow on the left of the list of droplet sizes to see the smallest one allowed, which should be $6/month.

   :::tip[**Using an even smaller droplet**]
   <Xplex /> can totally run on even smaller (e.g. the $4/month) droplets. But the DigitalOcean 1-click wizard doesn't allow selecting that. For that you have to start the droplet with normal Ubuntu image, and then install <Xplex /> with the [native](/setup/native) setup (advanced method).

   </details>

4. <details>
   <summary>Miscellaneous Choices &mdash; just leave them be</summary>
    No need to change anything in the `Additional storage`, `Backups` etc. advanced options. Though you **can** configure the `Choose Authentication Method` section, **you absolutely don't have to**. Just leave them as they are, unless you have a good reason to change them.

   </details>

5. <details>
   <summary>Confirm Choices &mdash; to create <Xplex /> instance</summary>
   Leave the quantity to `1 Droplet`. You can change the hostname to something you prefer, over the one given by default&mdash;but you don't have to. If you use tags to organize droplets, you can do so&mdash;but again&mdash;you don't have to.

   As the final step, click on `Create Droplet` button to confirm the choices & let it cook.

</Steps>

## Get Droplet IP Address

Once the droplet starts creating, you'll be taken to the dashboard. Wait for it to complete.

You'll see the IP address of the droplet on the right side of the droplet name. Copy that IP address, as you'll need it to access the <Xplex /> instance.

![get droplet info](/vendors/digitalocean/droplet_info.png)


## Open <Xplex isHQ /> Dashboard

Open a browser tab, paste the IP address of the droplet, and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. You'll see the <Xplex isHQ /> dashboard, which is the control panel for your <Xplex /> instance.

That's it... <Xplex /> is now live & ready for you to setup your [multi-streaming details](/setup/postinstall).
