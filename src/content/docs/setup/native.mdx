This is **not the recommended way to setup <Xplex />** (even as a developer environment), but if you're feeling adventurous&mdash;to build and deploy it without containerization, then here's how to do it.

:::caution[Brevity Alert]
This method expects you to be proficient with system administration; so trivial directions like ensuring superuser access, hanlding package manager etc. are kept aside. If you're not comfortable with these tasks, please consider using the [1-click](/setup/1-click) or [Docker](/setup/docker) setup instead.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>

1. <details>
   <summary>Install Dependencies</summary>

   Depending on the package manager the host system uses, the package names & the commands to install them will vary; please use the appropriate section below:
   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="APT">
       If you're on a Debian-based system, using [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)) as package manager (e.g. Ubuntu, OpenMediaVault, Linux Mint etc.) then run:

       ```bash
       # update installed packages
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt upgrade
       # install build dependencies
       sudo apt install -y build-essential git nodejs npm
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="DNF">
       If you're on a Fedora-based system, using [DNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNF_(software)) as package manager (e.g. RHEL, CentOS, Alma, Rocky, Amazon Linux etc.) then run:

       ```bash
       # update installed packages
       sudo dnf update
       # install build dependencies
       sudo dnf install -y gcc gcc-c++ git make nodejs nodejs-npm perl wget
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Others">
       If you've chosen to use a system that uses some different & obscure package manager, then you already know what you're doing and don't need hand holding to prepare for the build.

       Just make sure to update installed packages and then install the build dependencies.

       Here's a generic (and likely non-exhaustive) list of dependencies you may need:
       - gcc & g++
       - git & wget
       - make & autoconf
       - perl & perl-modules
       - nodejs & nodejs-npm

       Good luck!
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   :::caution[Just in Case]
   If you end up installing additional packages for a successful build, please [let us know](https://github.com/xplexHQ/core/issues).

   </details>

2. <details>
   <summary>Download Code</summary>

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Git">
       If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, you can clone the repository:

       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/xplexHQ/core.git
       cd xplex
       git checkout v1.0.0
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Zip">
       If you don't have Git installed, you can download the code as a ZIP archive:

       ```bash
       # avoid using latest development code, as it may be unstable
       # make sure to download archive of the latest tagged version:
       wget https://github.com/xplexHQ/core/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip
       unzip v1.0.0.zip
       cd xplex-1.0.0
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Tar">
       If you don't have Git installed, and instead of ZIP, you prefer TAR archives:

       ```bash
       # avoid using latest development code, as it may be unstable
       # make sure to download archive of the latest tagged version:
       wget https://github.com/xplexHQ/core/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.tar.gz
       tar -xzf v1.0.0.tar.gz
       cd xplex-1.0.0
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   </details>

3. <details>
   <summary>Run checks</summary>
   - [**Look out for conflicting nginx**](/refs/check/nginx)
   - [**Confirm required ports are free**](/refs/check/ports)
   - [**Set firewall rules to open the ports**](/refs/change/firewall)
   </details>

</Steps>

## Setup Script

Inside the directory, there's a `setup.sh`, which automates the tasks to get <Xplex /> up and running:

```bash title="NOTE: audit the script before running it"
sudo ./setup.sh
# or, you can configure and run each of its commands separately.
```

:::note[Time required to build `nginx-rtmp`]
Depending on the available compute resources, the build may take a few minutes to complete. On a VM with 4 modern CPU cores and 4GB RAM, it takes about 2-3 minutes.
:::

Open a browser & access your <Xplex isHQ /> dashboard at `http://<hostname-or-IP>/`. If you can see the dashboard, then <Xplex /> is up and running & ready for the [post-installation setup](/setup/postinstall). ðŸŽ‰
