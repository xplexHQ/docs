## Verify Installation

Before we get into the installation steps, let's verify if Docker is already installed on your system.

```bash title="Check Docker Installation"
docker --version
sudo docker run hello-world
```

If you see a version number and the `hello world` container runs without any issue, then Docker is already installed.

If not, then let's get started with the installation.

## Installation Script

```bash title="Get Docker One-liner"
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
```

This script will install Docker on any Linux host. Make sure to verify the installation by running the verification commands mentioned above.
