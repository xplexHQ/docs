As we'll be installing software and configuring services, it's a must to have superuser access to the host system. Try which one ever of the following options fits you the most, to verify root access:

<Steps>

1. <details>
   <summary>I used `root` user to login to this host</summary>
   ```bash title="Verify being root user"
   whoami
   ```
   If it returns `root` then you have root access.
   </details>

2. <details>
   <summary>My regular user has superuser privileges</summary>
   ```bash title="Verify being superuser"
   sudo -i
   # you will be prompted to enter your password
   ```
   If it succeeds then you've superuser access.
   </details>

3. <details>
   <summary>I know the `root` password, but my regular user isn't a superuser</summary>
   ```bash title="Verify having root credentials"
   su
   # you will be prompted to enter root password
   ```
   If it succeeds then you've root access. While it's possible to run the setup as root, it's generally not recommended.

   ```bash title="Add normal user to superuser group"
   # replace `<username>` with actual username
   adduser <username> sudo
   # this is for Debian/Ubuntu based systems
   ```
   Once you login with that user the next time, you can use `sudo` to run commands with superuser privileges. Please verify it's working before proceeding to the next steps.
   </details>

</Steps>

Once you've verified having superuser access, press <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> to exit root shell to become regular (albeit sudoer) user or type `exit` in the terminal and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to the same effect.
