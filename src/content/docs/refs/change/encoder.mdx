Make sure the encoding settings is the supported lowest common denominator of all the streaming service(s) you're targeting.

## What does it mean in practice?

For example:

- YouTube supports 4K@60fps stream, and you'll be perfectly fine to stream at 4K@60fps if you're only streaming to YouTube.
- But if you're also streaming to Twitch or Facebook, which doesn't support 4K, you'll have to stream at 1080p or lower.
- If you're also planning to stream to ùïè, which supports 1080p (Full HD), but doesn't support 60fps, you'll have to stream at 30fps.

The bitrate of your stream will have to be adjusted accordingly, to ensure the quality of the stream is maintained.

Expect a detailed guide on this soon.
