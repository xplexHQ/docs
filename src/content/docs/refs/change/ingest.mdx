import Xplex from '@components/Xplex.astro';
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Visit streaming services' dashboard(s) and note down the streaming endpoints & stream-keys.

:::danger[Attention]
Make sure to not share these keys with anyone, as they can be used by someone else to impersonate you & stream content to your account.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Twitch" icon="twitch">
    Visit Twitch's [ingest endpoint recommendation page](https://help.twitch.tv/s/twitch-ingest-recommendation) to discover the apt ingest server for your location, and checkout [stream key FAQ](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-stream-key-faq) for latest details on how to get your stream key.

    A typical Twitch ingest endpoint should look something like:

    ```bash
    rtmp://{LOC##}.contribute.live-video.net/app/{live_0000000_xxxxxxxxxxxx}
    ```

    The `{LOC##}` is the server location code, e.g. `del01` for Delhi, India. This may (and likely will) be different for you, depending on your ISP location & latency. The `{live_0000000_xxxxxxxxxxxx}` is the stream key and it's unique to your account.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="YouTube" icon="youtube">
    Please visit [YouTube's Live Dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard) to get your ingest endpoint & stream key.

    A typical YouTube ingest endpoint should look something like:

    ```bash
    rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/{####-####-####-####-####}
    ```

    YouTube's ingest URL should be the same for everyone, but still check your account to make sure. The `{####-####-####-####-####}` part is your stream key.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Others" icon="external">
    <Xplex /> supports all RTMP-based streaming services, so you can use it with any service that provides an RTMP ingest URL like this:

    ```bash
    rtmp://{ingest-server}/{application-path}/{unique-key}
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
