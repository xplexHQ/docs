<Xplex /> can be setup to run on a wide variety of systems (though, some may need more cups of coffee than others); but you can broadly group them into one of these 3 categories:

<Steps>

1. <details>
   <summary>**Use New Cloud Host** <Badge text="recommended" /></summary>

   :::note[Who is this option for?]
   You're not into system administration. You just want to get things done and move on.
   :::

   Just create an instance on the [cloud provider of your choice](/refs/choose/clouds), and then follow the guide on how-to run <Xplex /> as a [1-click solution](/setup/1-click) or a [Docker container](/setup/docker).
   </details>
2. <details>
   <summary>**Use Existing Cloud Host**</summary>

   :::note[Who is this for?]
   You're a system administrator with prior understanding of self-hosting services and already have cloud VMs where you may want to add <Xplex /> to the existing mix.
   :::
   If you're choosing this option then you don't need hand-holding, but you should run the checks to ensure the host system has the [ports available](/refs/check/ports/) & won't [run into conflicts](/refs/check/nginx/).
   </details>
3. <details>
   <summary>**Use Local System as Host**</summary>

   :::note[Who is this for?]
   You're setting up a development environment, or are running a homelab or NAS server, and want to add <Xplex /> to the existing mix of services.
   :::

   <details>
   <summary>Ensure it's an `x86_64` system</summary>
     - A lot of homelab servers are `ARM` based, and <Xplex /> doesn't support it [yet](/intro/internals#future-roadmap).
     - You're welcome to [try](/setup/native), and if you succeed, please share your experience.
     - On a Linux system, you can run `uname -m` to check the architecture.
   </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Ensure it's running a modern OS</summary>
     You should preferably be running Linux, especially if you want to run it natively without Docker. If you're on Windows or macOS, then you can run <Xplex /> with Docker.

     If you have the flexibility to choose the distro, then go with a Debian-based distro like Ubuntu LTS, latest stable version of Debian or OpenMediaVault etc.

     Nothing wrong with other distros, but as we use Debian base images for creating <Xplex /> containers, it's better tested & less likely to have unpredictable surprises.
   </details>
   <details>
   <summary>Ensure a stable wired network</summary>
     As we're dealing with video streaming, a stable wired network is a must. If you're on a wireless network, then you may face issues with latency, packet loss & jitter.
   </details>

   This has the most instance-to-instance variance & undiscovered edge cases. You should definitely run the checks, and be on the lookout for any issues that you may face.

   But if you're using this option, then hopefully you know what you're doing. So, **all the best!**

   </details>

</Steps>

:::note[Do I **\*have to\*** use Docker?]
<Xplex /> can be installed on a [native Linux host](/setup/native) without Docker; but the experience of [deploying it with Docker](/setup/docker) is much more convenient & less prone to situational variations.
:::

:::tip[Do I **\*have to\*** use Linux as host?]
To run <Xplex /> with Docker, the host system can even be running Windows or macOS. It doesn't make much sense, but it's possible. A Linux host is only a must to run it natively.
:::

:::danger[Do I **\*have to\*** use a cloud instance?]
If you run all these extra processes & services on your main workstation, then you're adding more compute & network overhead for your system to handle. If you use another system on the same network; your workstation's performance may not suffer, but the bandwidth still might.

So it's best to use a host that's not in your network, is always on, and closer to the ingest servers.

Which is why using a cloud instance is the most sensible choice.
