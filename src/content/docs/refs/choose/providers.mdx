We have no affiliation with the cloud providers, but should you choose to continue their services after the credits expire and spend a small amount, we'll receive an one-time cloud credit.

There's no obligation, but your support would make a meaningful contribution to the project.

## Compare the Cloud Providers

Here's a list of some popular cloud providers' <Badge text="cheapest" /> compute unit offerings, either of which should be enough to run <Xplex /> (however, the author has only extensively used DigitalOcean):
| Cloud Host   | Compute      | Bandwidth | Cost/month |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| DigitalOcean | 1core, 0.5GB | 500GB     | $4         |
| Linode       | 1core, 1.0GB | 1000GB    | $5         |
| Vultr        | 1core, 0.5GB | 500GB     | $2.5       |

<summary>If this is your first time setting up a cloud server, then start with [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9638716)</summary>
- You can do a lot of trial & error with the $10 credit for a month.
- You can run upto 4 parallel $2.5 instances; to try different configurations.
- And if you mess up, you can just destroy the instance & start over.
  - Instances are charged for the duration they're running.
  - You're not billed twice for destroying and recreating instances.

<details>
<summary>If you're already familiar with cloud servers, then start with [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/986bbf7090cd)</summary>
- They have a lot of (and arguably, the best) documentation & community support.
- You can get $200 credit for 2 months, which is a lot of time to get comfortable.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Feel free to switch host at any time, if you're not having a good experience</summary>
- Don't be confused trying to find a perfect match.
- You can always switch to a different provider later.
- The best part of using Docker is that&mdash;apart from the IP addresses of the hosts&mdash;the end result should be predictably the exact same in all cases.
