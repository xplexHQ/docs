import Xplex from '@components/Xplex.astro';
import { FileTree, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

At its core, <Xplex /> is an [nginx](http://nginx.org/) server with [RTMP support](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module), which pushes the incoming stream to multiple RTMP endpoints—the platforms you stream to.

<Xplex /> also includes a simple web dashboard for config management, called <Xplex isHQ />.

---

## Project structure

Here's how the <Xplex /> [`core`](https://github.com/xplexHQ/core) is organized:

<FileTree>

- .github/ ----> GitHub Actions & CI workflows  
- app/ --------> Source code for <Xplex isHQ />  
- conf/ -------> RTMP & HTTP configs for nginx  
- daemons/ ----> systemd units for service control  
- **compose.yaml** --> Docker Compose definition  
- Dockerfile ---> Container build steps  
- LICENSE -----> Licensed under MPLv2.0  
- setup.sh ----> Manual setup script  
- xplex.sh ----> Container start script

</FileTree>

## How it's built

<Steps>

1. <details>
   <summary>Custom-build the `nginx-rtmp` container</summary>
   Run `docker build --target nginx -t xplex/nginx .` if you just need the nginx base image.
   </details>
2. <details>
   <summary>Integrate with a Node.js base image</summary>
   This setup simplifies things—though decoupling Node.js is on the roadmap.
    </details>
3. <details>
   <summary>Configure HTTP and RTMP servers</summary>
   HTTP is used to serve the dashboard; reverse-proxied to port 80 for easy access. RTMP is used to receive the stream and push it to the platforms.
   </details>
4. <details>
   <summary>Deploy <Xplex isHQ /> server</summary>
   A lightweight Node.js app to manage and store ingest URLs.
   </details>
5. <details>
   <summary>Launch in sequence</summary>
   First the dashboard API, then the nginx server with RTMP support.
   </details>

</Steps>

## Future Roadmap

- [ ] ARM & RISC-V architecture support  
- [ ] Unit and integration testing  
- [ ] Major upgrades to <Xplex isHQ />  
- [ ] HTTPS / Let's Encrypt support  
- [ ] One-click provider integrations  
- [ ] **Stretch goals**: RTMPS, RTSP, SRT, HLS, NDI support
