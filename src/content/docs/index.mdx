#### <Xplex />—your personal, open-source multi-streaming server to ***go live everywhere, all at once.***

## Why xplex?

Streaming to just one platform is limiting. <Xplex /> removes that barrier by letting you stream to *all* the platforms you've configured—Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, and more—**simultaneously**.

:::note[Think of it this way...]
Just like an HDMI splitter sends one video signal to multiple screens, <Xplex /> forwards your stream to multiple platforms—no extra load on your main computer, no compromises.

## Who is it for?

<Xplex /> is built for content creators who want:

- Greater reach without platform lock-in  
- Freedom from expensive multi-streaming services  
- Full control over their stream data and infrastructure  
- An open source, extensible, self-hostable solution

:::tip[Ready for everyone]
**Previously only suited for technical users—now anyone can multi-stream with <Xplex />.** With the new [1-click setup](/setup/1-click), getting started is easier than ever.

## How does it run?

You can deploy <Xplex /> in a way that fits your setup:

- **Cloud server (recommended)** — ideal for network stability and bandwidth  
- **Local machine or homelab** — works well, as long as it's not your main workstation  

This [guide on choosing hosts](/refs/choose/hosts) offers practical advice based on your use case.

:::note[Compute & Complexity]
No transcoding means low overhead. Your stream is passed through as-is, preserving quality and minimizing compute needs. Even a budget VPS can handle it.

## What does it cost?

<Xplex /> is **free and open source**, licensed under **MPLv2.0**.

Your only cost is hosting. Depending on your cloud provider, you can get started with minimal investment — or even free credits via [our provider reference](/refs/choose/providers).
