title: Technical Overview
description: The explanation of xplex's technical implementation.

import Xplex from '@components/Xplex.astro';
import { FileTree, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Abstract

At its core, <Xplex /> is an [rtmp-enabled](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module) [nginx server](http://nginx.org/) that pushes identical copies of incoming RTMP streams to one or more pre-configured RTMP endpoints.

It also provides a simple web-based dashboard with REST API&mdash;called <Xplex isHQ />&mdash;to conveniently manage the ingest URLs.

## Structure

<FileTree>

- .github/ ---> actions & workflows automations
- app/ -------> source files for <Xplex isHQ /> server
- conf/ ------> nginx configs for HTTP & RTMP
- daemons/ ---> systemd service management units
- .gitignore
- **compose.yaml** --> docker-compose file
- Dockerfile -> containerization instructions
- LICENSE ----> source is available under **MPLv2.0**
- README.md
- setup.sh ---> <Xplex /> manual setup script
- xplex.sh ---> <Xplex /> container startup script

</FileTree>

## Operations

<Steps>

1. **There's no official `nginx-rtmp` container; so first, we built one from scratch.**
   > You can build it by explicitly mentioning the target as `nginx` instead of `xplex` as the default target; e.g. `docker build --target nginx -t xplex/nginx .`

2. **Next up we implant the `nginx-rtmp` installation on a Node.js base image.**
   > This is simpler than installing Node.js on the `nginx-rtmp` image. We may want to move out or refactor Node.js dependency in future.

3. **Then we apply configurations for the HTTP & RTMP servers.**
   > The HTTP server reverse proxies the <Xplex isHQ /> server to run on port 8080 to port 80.
   > Reverse proxying is not functionally necessary for the setup to work (API or stream).
   > But accessing dashboard over port 80 the easiest way to validate nginx build success.

4. **Then we install <Xplex isHQ /> as a simple Node.js app to manage the ingest URLs**
   > This is the reason for our Node.js dependency, and it needs a massive overhaul.

5. **Finally, we start the processes inside the container in sequence**
   > The Node.js server is started first, ready for nginx to proxy. Then the nginx process is started with daemon mode off.

</Steps>
