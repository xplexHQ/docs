#### <Xplex /> is your personal, open source, multi-streaming server to ***simultaneously stream to as many platforms as you want to***.

---

## What does it do?

<Xplex /> acts as a bridge between your streaming software (e.g. OBS, XSplit etc.) and the streaming services (e.g. Twitch, YouTube etc.). It takes the stream from your streaming software and goes live on all of the streaming services you've configured it to&mdash;**all at once**!

:::note[Think of it this way...]
Imagine <Xplex /> is an HDMI splitter. You connect your streaming software to <Xplex /> (like you connect your HDMI source to the splitter), and <Xplex /> forwards the stream to multiple streaming services (like the splitter forwards the video to multiple screens).

## Who is it for?

<Xplex /> is for content creators who want to reach a wider audience by simultaneously streaming to multiple platforms, without costly subscriptions or complicated setups, while retaining full control of the choice, flexibility, extensibility & the data.

~~For now, it takes running at least an oneliner command in a terminal to make it work; so you could say it's for technically adept streamers.~~

> **Now, with the all-new [1-click setup](/setup/1-click), it's for anyone who wants to multi-stream.**

## Where does it run?

Ideally you would want to setup <Xplex /> on a cloud server with good network bandwidth, so it can handle multiple streams. You can also run it on your local machine, or on a homelab server, but you should avoid running it on your main workstation.

This [reference on host selection](/refs/choose/hosts) goes a bit deeper to explain the reasoning behind this.

:::tip[Compute & Complexity]
There's no transcoding involved, so not only the stream quality remains the same as what you're sending from your streaming software, but there's no significant overhead on the server either. You can run <Xplex /> even on the lowest-end VM/VPS that cloud providers have to offer.
:::

## How much does it cost?

<Xplex /> is **free and open source software**. You can run it on your own home server, or use a cloud server to host it. The only cost you would incur is the server cost; and the exact value depends on your cloud provider and their pricing of the compute unit of your choice.

The [reference for choosing cloud providers](/refs/choose/providers) has cost comparison for basic estimation. It also has **referral sign up links** with free credits for you to get started with the evaluation.
